# Workshop goals and topics

 - We want to make the computers work harder so we can do more meaningful work. This workshop introduces foundational tools and techniques that make computational projects simpler, more powerful, and more reproducible.

 - By the end of the workshop, attendees will be able to
   - Use RStudio to build R scripts, examine R data structures, navigate directories and files
   - Understand basics of importing data into R and ways to clean/manipulate data
   - Visualize data as plots

 - Our purpose is not to be exhaustive, there is a lot that we cannot cover in
   the allotted time, and we don't expect anyone to be an expert at the end of
   the workshop. 

- We hope that this introduction helps you over the steepest parts of the learning curve and gives a sense of what’s possible so you can 
recognize these techniques when you see them and, with some independent study, apply them in your own work.

 - Please let us know if there is anything we can do to improve the workshop experience.
